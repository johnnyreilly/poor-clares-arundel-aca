        <h3>St Clare of Assisi – Her Prayers</h3>
        <p>A way of meditating with St Clare through letting the message of her letters touch you.</p>
        <p>
            Among the few writings left to us by St Clare there are four letters written to a Princess in far away
            Bohemia (Czechoslovakia). This lady, Princess Agnes, had heard of St Clare through some Friars who went to
            Prague from Italy. She wrote to Clare to find out what she should do, and a correspondence developed over
            the last 20 years of Clare’s life. None of Agnes’ letters have come down to us, and only four of the ones
            Clare wrote. They reveal the heart of her spirituality: she sought poverty and humility in order to become
            filled with the riches of the Father, through Jesus His Son. What follows here are the four letters in
            miniature. Here you will find Clare’s way of living and praying, which can be a guide to all Christians.

        <h4>The First Letter: Clare’s Jesus and yours</h4>
        <p>
            Look!
            <br />
            The Lord Jesus Christ –<br />
            Love Him, touch Him, accept Him.
            <br />
            <br />
            His power is stronger,
            <br />
            His generosity greater,
            <br />
            His face is more beautiful,
            <br />
            He loves more tenderly,
            <br />
            He is more gracious, more courteous –<br />
            <br />
            See now
            <br />
            You are held tightly in His embrace.
            <br />
            <br />
            NOW
            <br />
            You are His beloved
            <br />
            His mother
            <br />
            His sister.
            <br />
            <br />
            For He is your Lover
            <br />
            Your Son
            <br />
            Your Brother.
            <br />
            <br />

            <br />
            Making you rich.
            <br />
            <br />
            Man Despised –<br />
            Now and forever
            <br />
            Son of the Most High Father
            <br />
            <br />
            and
            <br />
            <br />
            Giver of Joy –<br />
            Serve Him with total desire.
            <br />

            <br />
            THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.

        <h4>The Second Letter: Faith Journey</h4>
        <p>
            THE KING OF KINGS calls his daughter
            <br />
            The Lord of Lords beckons His handmaid.
            <br />
            Believe Him, the Giver of Grace
            <br />
            Giver of each good gift,
            <br />
            Creator of goodness in you,
            <br />
            And thank Him.
            <br />
            <br />
            The KING himself makes you His companion –<br />
            This is your perfection.
            <br />
            <br />
            Follow His footprints
            <br />
            In a spirit of humility and love
            <br />
            Unswervingly seek poverty –<br />
            Remember Him . . . . <br />
            Be aware of Him . . . . <br />
            Journey on swiftly,
            <br />
            Keeping hold of your aim, <br />
            with lightness of step <br />
            and freedom of movement <br />
            swiftly keep moving.
            <br />
            <br />
            Let no dust collect in your steps <br />
            on the path to happiness.
            <br />
            God carefully, securely, joyfully, <br />
            let nothing block the way <br />
            on which the Spirit of the Lord <br />
            has called you <br />
            to embrace the Poor Christ.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a poor and obedient virgin <br />
            embrace the poor Christ.
            <br />
            Gaze long at Him –<br />
            The poor condemned Christ . . .<br />
            Ponder and weigh in your heart <br />
            and contemplate Him, your Beloved.
            <br />
            <br />
            The fairest of men <br />
            is now the lowest of all.
            <br />
            Despised by them all, <br />
            His whole body beaten and struck <br />
            till, desolate – <br />
            He dies – <br />
            on the Cross.
            <br />
            <br />
            Suffer with Him <br />
            and so with Him reign
            <br />
            Weep with Him, <br />
            then with Him be joyful.
            <br />
            Exchange what passes, what fades <br />
            for Life for ever and ever <br />
            with Him
            <br />
            The KING OF KINGS
            <br />
            who calls.

        <h4>The Third Letter: Clare’s Joy in Transformation</h4>
        <p>
            Sister and Beloved <br />
            of the Most High King of Heaven,
            <br />
            may you be very joyful in the Lord!
            <br />
            Be not entangled with bitterness
            <br />
            or a cloud of sadness.
            <br />
            <br />
            Joy! That you are in Christ, redeemed.
            <br />
            Joy! In your well-being,
            <br />
            Joy! In your happiness.
            <br />
            Joy! In your progress, your growth.
            <br />
            <br />
            That you, poor and humble, <br />
            follow in the footprints of Christ <br />
            poor and humble – Joy!
            <br />
            That you are delivered and safe <br />
            from evil and pride and vanity – Joy!
            <br />
            <br />
            That you love to be poor, <br />
            and so have found in your heart <br />
            desire for God – <br />
            a treasure which ALL have hidden within – <br />
            Joy!
            <br />
            <br />
            That you work with God Himself
            <br />
            to support the weak and the falling – <br />
            Joy!
            <br />
            So, rejoicing in such marvelous things
            <br />
            <br />
            Place your mind in the Mirror of Eternity
            <br />
            -Jesus Christ –<br />
            <br />
            Place your soul <br />
            in the Radiance of His Glory
            <br />
            -Lord of Lords –<br />
            <br />
            Place your heart <br />
            in the Image of His Divine Being <br />
            -Son of God –<br />
            <br />
            In contemplation <br />
            be transformed into God’s image <br />
            completely.
            <br />
            <br />
            Then may you taste His hidden sweetness
            <br />
            Then love Him totally <br />
            who gave Himself totally <br />
            for your love.
            <br />
            <br />
            Extravagantly gifted by Him <br />
            to be the most worthy of all creatures, <br />
            be that faithful person <br />
            who is His dwelling place, <br />
            His comfortable home.
            <br />
            <br />
            Like His most sweet Mother <br />
            who carried in so small a space <br />
            that Son of hers <br />
            whom the Heavens could not contain.
            <br />
            <br />
            So you, in humility and poverty <br />
            like her,
            <br />
            will carry Him spiritually in your body, <br />
            hold Him, by whom you and all things <br />
            are held together, <br />
            possess Him without fear of losing Him.
            <br />
            <br />
            May you do well in the Lord!

            (written in the year Clare died - 1253)
        </h4>
        <p>
            Sing a new song <br />
            before God’s throne and the Lamb, <br />
            Beloved of Jesus Christ.
            <br />
            Follow the Lamb wherever He may go,
            <br />
            You, who belong completely to Him who takes away the sin of the world.
            <br />
            Come to His Sacred Banquet – <br />
            Cling to Him with all your heart –<br />
            Praise His beauty there, <br />
            as they do in heaven.
            <br />
            Accept the touch of His love –<br />
            and be moved by Him
            <br />
            <br />
            Gaze long at Him – <br />
            and be renewed.

            <br />
            Feel His sweetness overflowing in you.
            <br />
            To keep Him in your mind brings gentle light, <br />
            seeing Him glorious is to be happy <br />
            with everyone. <br />
            There, in heaven, <br />
            magnificent, in light, <br />
            the clearest Mirror.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beloved of Jesus Christ, <br />
            look into that Mirror every day. <br />
            Time and again study your face in His, <br />
            and put on His kind of clothes, <br />
            within and without – His strengths.
            <br />
            <br />
            Look, and see in this Mirror <br />
            shining out to us all <br />
            blessed poverty, holy humility <br />
            and love no words can express.
            <br />
            <br />
            Look! Here! At the Mirror’s edge <br />
            a baby in swaddling clothes – <br />
            King and Lord of heaven and earth – <br />
            In a manger! <br />
            <br />
            Look further, into the centre –<br />
            He endures the work and the stress
            <br />
            day after endless day, for us – <br />
            The Redeemer.
            <br />
            <br />
            Look! Look yet again, at the Mirror’s farthest end – <br />
            in love no words can express <br />
            He wills to suffer and die <br />
            a most shameful kind of death <br />
            on the Tree of the Cross.
            <br />
            <br />
            “O you who pass and look, <br />
            have you seen sorrow like this?” <br />
            He laments from this Mirror Cross.
            <br />
            “I ponder it all the time <br />
            and my heart sinks,” <br />
            united, we reply.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beloved of Jesus Christ, <br />
            be burned up with the intensity of this love.
            <br />
            Contemplate His riches, His honours, His delights.
            <br />
            With deep desire <br />
            and the love of all your heart <br />
            run towards Him as He draws you.
            <br />
            <br />
            Run, do not tire – <br />
            He will bring you to His wine cellar – <br />
            He will happily embrace you, <br />
            and love you totally <br />
            in the happiest way <br />
            for ever and ever!
