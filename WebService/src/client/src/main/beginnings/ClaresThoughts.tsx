        <h3>St Clare of Assisi – Her Thoughts</h3>

        <p>From the Rule St Clare wrote</p>

        <h4>The basis of everything</h4>

        <p>
            The form of life of the Order of the Poor Sisters that Blessed Francis established is this: to observe the
            Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, by living in obedience, without anything of one’s own and in chastity.
        </p>

        <h4>Mutual care and love</h4>

        <p>
            Let each confidently make their needs known to another. For if a mother loves and cares for her child
            according to the flesh, how much more attentively should a Sister love and care for her sister according to
            the Spirit.
        </p>

        <h4>Forgiveness</h4>

        <p>
            If it should happen that an occasion of trouble or scandal should arise between sister and sister, through a
            word or gesture, let her who was the cause of the trouble ask pardon and beg her to intercede for her to the
            Lord that he forgive her. Let the other sister, mindful of that word of the Lord, “If you do not forgive
            from the heart, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you,” generously pardon her sister every injury
            she has done to her.
        </p>

        <h4>Avoiding division</h4>

        <p>
            I admonish and exhort you in the Lord Jesus Christ to beware of all pride, vainglory, envy, avarice, care
            and anxiety about this world, detraction and murmuring, dissension and division. Always be eager to preserve
            the unity of mutual love which is the bond of perfection.
        </p>

        <h4>Following Christ’s teaching about suffering in patience</h4>

        <p>
            Let them direct their attention to what they should desire above all else: to have the Spirit of the Lord
            and its holy activity, to pray always to Him with a pure heart, and to have humility, patience in difficulty
            and infirmity, and to love those who persecute, blame and accuse us, for the Lord says: Blessed are those
            who suffer persecution for the sake of justice, for theirs in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever perseveres
            to the end will be saved.
        </p>

        <h4>St Clare’s blessing</h4>

        <p>
            Always be lovers of your souls
            <br />
            and those of all your sisters. <br />
            And may you always be eager <br />
            to observe what you have promised the Lord. <br />
            May the Lord always be with you <br />
            and may you always be with him. <br />
            Amen.
        </p>
