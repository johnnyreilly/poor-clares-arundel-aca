        <h3>St Francis of Assisi – His Thoughts</h3>

        <h4>Know yourself - Admonition XIII</h4>

        <p>
            Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God. A person cannot know how much
            patience and humility they have within themselves as long as everything goes well with them. But when the
            time comes in which those who should do them justice do quite the opposite to them, they have only as much
            patience and humility as they have on that occasion and no more.
        </p>

        <h4>How we can relate intimately with Christ - Letter to the Faithful 2</h4>

        <p>
            We must never desire to be over others, rather we must be servants and subject to every human creature for
            God’s sake. And upon all men and women, if they have done these things and have persevered to the end, the
            spirit of the Lord will rest, and He will make His home and dwelling among them.
        </p>

        <h4>True love - Admonition XXV</h4>

        <p>
            Blessed is the person who would love and respect another as much when they are far away from them as they
            would when they are with them, and who would not say anything behind their back which in love they could not
            say to their face.
        </p>

        <h4>Humility - Admonition XIX</h4>

        <p>
            Blessed is the servant who esteems himself no better when he is praised and exalted by people than when he
            is considered worthless, simple and despicable; for what a person is before God, that they are and nothing
            more.
        </p>

        <h4>Be open to the mystery of God</h4>

        <p>
            In the holy love, which is God, I beg you, to overcome every obstacle and put aside every care and anxiety,
            to strive as best you can to serve, love, honour and adore the Lord God with a clean heart and a pure mind,
            for this is what he desires above all things.
        </p>

        <h4>About working in a Christian way</h4>

        <p>
            Those to whom the Lord has given the grace of working should do their work faithfully and devotedly, so
            that, avoiding idleness, the enemy of the soul, they do not extinguish the Spirit of holy prayer and
            devotion to which all other things of our earthly existence must contribute.
