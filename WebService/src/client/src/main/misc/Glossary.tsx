        <h4>Palm Sunday</h4>

        <p>
            This is a celebration of the day Jesus rode into Jerusalem the week before he died. All the people greeted
            him with branches of palms torn from the trees, and shouts of Hurray! It is celebrated in Christian churches
            on the Sunday before Easter Day.
        </p>

        <h4>Friars Minor</h4>

        <p>These are male followers of the way of life of St Francis</p>

        <h4>Pope</h4>

        <p>
            He is the elected head of the Roman Catholic Church. He is the successor of St Peter, whom Jesus made “the
            rock on which he would build his church.”
        </p>

        <h4>Altar boys</h4>

        <p>These are young lads who assist the priest during Church services in the Catholic Church.</p>

        <h4>Holy Mass</h4>

        <p>
            This is a service in the Catholic Church in which we carry out the wish of Jesus to do what he did when he
            had his last supper with his close friends. During the meal he took some bread, gave thanks to God, and
            said: “This is my Body. – Do what I have done in memory of me”. Then he took a goblet of wine and said:
            “This is my Blood which will be shed for you. Do this in memory of me.” In doing this he wanted to make it
            possible for us to be present in a spiritual way at his death and rising from that death, and to be fed by
            his life, because he becomes really present in the bread and the wine after the priest has said Jesus’ own
            words, as above.
        </p>

        <p>This service includes listening to the Word of God in the Bible.</p>

        <p>Other words which are used for this are Eucharist and Holy Communion.</p>

        <p>This service is the very heart of the Catholic Church and is a Spiritual Mystery of Faith.</p>

        <h4>Anglican Friars</h4>

        <p>These are members of the Church of England who follow the way of life of St Francis.</p>

        <h4>Abbess</h4>

        <p>She is the Superior of a community of Poor Clare sisters, elected every 3 years by the Community</p>

        <h4>Blessed Sacrament</h4>

        <p>
            After the priest has said the words of Jesus over the bread and wine at Holy Mass, what is not distributed
            in Holy Communion to the people is kept in a special locked place on the altar called a Tabernacle. This is
            so that it can be used to give anyone who falls really ill, and also as a focus where people can pray and
            know that Jesus is really present there in the form of Bread.
