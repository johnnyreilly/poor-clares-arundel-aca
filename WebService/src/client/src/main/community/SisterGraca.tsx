        <h3>Sister Graça's Story</h3>

        <p>
            Each step of my journey has been full of gifts – and ‘gifts are of their nature surprises’!!! But it all
            began out of inner struggle: I was 21, life seemed pointless and aimless. People around me seemed happy but
            mostly because they were looking forward to a holiday, or to a party, or to other things that I liked and
            enjoy as well, but they so were temporary, once they were over then the only thing to do was to begin to
            prepare for the next one!
        </p>

        <p>
            I wanted more out of life: I wanted to be happy but not just in ‘spurts’. I felt very disheartened and alone
            because I was looking for something but I did not know what so I did not know where to look or who to talk
            to about it! One day I came across a book “The Story of a Soul” with a photo of St Thérèse of Lisieux on its
            cover – I knew a bit about Thérèse but what made me buy the book was the photo, I had no idea that a Saint
            had ever been photographed! I was still on page one when this came to me: ‘I am loved by God’ and ‘I want to
            love God with all of me - I am going to be a Nun.’ I couldn’t believe that this was happening to me yet it
            was all so clear. A huge flood of joy and happiness rose up in me and I felt the presence of God so
            intimately, like being with a good friend.
        </p>

        <p>
            I knew that there were lots of different kinds of Nuns but I felt very attracted to two ‘kinds’ which seemed
            to me to be opposed to one another: One was to be a missionary – like St Francis Xavier, I wanted to go and
            tell the whole world about God’s love for every single person; the other was to be a contemplative – to live
            a life, like Therese, dedicated to prayer. I did not know which to choose so I prayed: “OK God you are the
            One who is calling me, so you choose - it is over to You now!”
        </p>

        <p>
            I knew He would answer me but I had not expected it to be so quickly! That very day, in London, I met two
            Nuns who said that they were Poor Clares!!!! I did not know anything about this ‘kind’ of Order but when
            later, someone explained a bit about them, I knew, without doubt, that this was His answer: ‘Graça, be a
            Poor Clare’! I knew that this was what I had been looking for and this was going to be for the whole of my
            life! The whole thing was becoming a reality and I couldn’t wait …
        </p>

        <p>
            Everyone who knows me knows that I love speed because I do everything at 100 miles an hour (something I have
            to work on all the time) but there is only one thing in which I am very slow: Trust! As soon as I
            encountered objections I began to loose trust in myself and in God. And so eleven long years went by; during
            which I lived a ‘dead’ life, I lost interest in life and avoided any reminders of the fact that I had once
            wanted something so much. I carried a weight of sadness and guilt around with me because I knew I had let
            God down as well as myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was only in my 30’s, after encountering God anew through the Bible, that the longing to become a nun
            surfaced again. I felt HIS love in me very alive, (just like it had done before) but this time this love
            triggered off a longing to embrace every single human being with this same love. At the time I was being
            helped to pray with the Bible by a Jesuit priest, Fr Hawe, and it was he who suggested the Poor Clares in
            Arundel. I was quite fearful but I agreed to spend a weekend at the convent in Arundel; I did not want to
            speak to any of the nuns, only to spend time alone with God. It was then that I discovered what
            contemplative prayer was – I named it: “Just Being!” I had never been aware of praying in this way before –
            there were no words! It was strange and yet familiar; it felt like when I was little, floating in the sea
            with a rubber ring around me – I felt safe and a deep peace enveloped me. By the end of the weekend I knew
            that God was indeed saying YES to me and I answered YES! Our YESes had met! I left full of joy but worried
            too: How can this ever become a reality? I wanted to join straight away, as quickly as possible –now I
            wanted speed!!! As I had expected there were lots of difficulties and problems which delayed things.
            Throughout this phrase came to me: Love has brought me this far. I did not know where I had got it from but
            I kept saying it and hearing it in me; when things got tough I repeated it and it reminded me of God’s love
            for me and that He was looking after me and not just me, but also all those who were opposing the idea. When
            people asked me how I knew this life was for me, I answered that when my sisters had got married I had asked
            the same thing: How do you know? The answer that they gave me was the same I had to give: “I just know!” It
            is a knowing from ‘within’ which may seem illogical.
        </p>

        <p>It was another 2 years before I could join.</p>

        <p>
            I had imagined that in order to become a Poor Clare I had to be forced into a ‘mould’, and then at the end
            of the ‘formation’ time I would be popped out of that mould and: Here you are, a brand new Poor Clare!!!
            This was not at all what formation was like; instead I was gently led to find who I am and in doing so
            discover that to be a Poor Clare was to be my real self! This was such an amazing thing to me.{' '}
        </p>

        <p>
            There was one thing that still puzzled me because I still felt very drawn to be a missionary – ‘How could
            that be as I was now in an enclosed community?’ The answer came as I learnt more of Francis and Clare and
            experienced prayer more fully; then what Thérèse had helped me see came alive: through prayer my every act
            of Love reaches the whole world. I don’t know how else to explain this except to say it in one word: LOVE.
