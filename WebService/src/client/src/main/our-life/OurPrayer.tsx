        <h3>Our Prayer</h3>

        <p>Our life of prayer falls into three natural parts. These are:</p>

        <p>
            The Prayer of the Church, which is sometimes called the Divine Office and which punctuates our day with
            hymns, psalms and spiritual canticles, as St Paul recommended.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our personal prayer time alone with God. There are two hours set aside for this each day though our hope is
            that our whole day can be filled with prayer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our specific intercession for the needs of the Church, of our friends and those who contact us asking us to
            support them with our prayer. This takes place specifically at Morning and Evening Prayer and at many
            private moments throughout the day.
        </p>
