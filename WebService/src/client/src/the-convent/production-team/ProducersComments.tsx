        <h3>A view from the Executive Producer, John Blake</h3>

        <h4>What were we trying to do?</h4>

        <p>
            We never pretended that our volunteers were going to learn how to be nuns. We didn’t set out to recruit
            members for the Roman Catholic church, even less were we looking for novices. We had no ambitions for
            Christian conversion. We simply offered 4 people the unique opportunity to live alongside an enclosed order,
            and to follow their life.
        </p>

        <p>
            We had a two-fold purpose – first to find a way to explain the traditions and purpose of monastic life in
            terms that might seem relevant to a contemporary TV audience, second to explore some issues of modern
            women’s life – such as ambition, achievement, relationships, esteem – in a context that might shed more
            light than the ‘10 ways to self-improvement’ style of much contemporary journalism.
        </p>

        <h4>Why did people take part?</h4>

        <p>
            More than 500 women volunteered to take part in THE CONVENT. The production team was impressed that so many
            were keen to discover what a religious life was all about.
        </p>

        <p>
            There were many motives – some candidates were profoundly unhappy about a recent life experience, some knew
            that their reasons were more deep-seated, some were purely intellectual, some had never been able to ‘get’
            religion at all but were curious, even envious, about the impact that faith made on the lives of close
            friends or relatives. Very few were observant religious followers. Some had a trace memory of prayer or
            worship, as a child. Most felt they were missing something – they had a spiritual gap that the material
            gifts of contemporary life didn’t seem to fill.
        </p>

        <h4>Why did we choose Angela, Debi, Iona and Victoria?</h4>

        <p>
            We had no stereotypes in mind when we began our search. We wanted to find people whose personal stories
            might resonate with a wide range of women, and also male viewers. Our main criteria for selection were that
            the motives were sincere, and that the volunteers had an ‘open heart’. They needed to be psychologically
            strong enough to undertake the challenge of separation from friends and family, while they were confronting
            their own issues in a rigorous and disciplined environment. All four fitted the bill in different ways –
            even though the experience was to challenge each of them to extremes.
        </p>

        <h4>Does ‘The Convent’ make good television?</h4>

        <p>
            We knew from making THE MONASTERY that some core principles of monastic life – community, discipline and
            silence – had struck a chord not only in the surprised volunteers but also with an exceptionally large TV
            audience. Clearly we were onto something. That series regularly attracted nearly 2.4 million viewers.
        </p>

        <h4>What can the programmes achieve?</h4>

        <p>
            I hope that THE CONVENT will touch people in ways they had forgotten television could – maybe they will find
            an echo of their own lives, a personal resonance whose frequency has been lost in the airwaves.{' '}
        </p>

        <p>
            Hopefully we have shown that TV programmes on religious subjects can be funny, emotional, accessible,
            gripping and stimulating. We hope we are not preaching to the converted, and indeed, we hope we have not
            preached at all. We hope that THE CONVENT might help people deal with important issues in their lives and
            explore profound spiritual values at the same time.
        </p>

        <p>
            It would be good if the benefits of the programmes go beyond the experience of our four volunteers. Viewers
            will have a unique opportunity to glimpse into the world of the Poor Clares, and they will see a world of
            compassion, love and beauty. They will see a daily struggle for discipline, honesty and truth and they might
            just begin to wonder themselves how that might come about.
