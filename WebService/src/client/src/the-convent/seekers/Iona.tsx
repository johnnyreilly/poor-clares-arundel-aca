        <h4>Before</h4>

        <p>
            In August 2005 I’d been traveling around the south of France and when I got back friends from church came to
            me with the idea of going into The Convent, as they’d seen adverts for it and thought of me. I thought it an
            interesting idea but not very relevant to my life and where it was going . . .and as I’m a singer and very
            much wanted one day to get married, it didn’t seem right.
        </p>

        <p>
            I went away on a Christian Week Away called Soul Survivor. While I was there I had a vision of God being my
            husband and God putting a question mark over the idea of me getting married one day . . in part this was
            amazing and beautiful but also I felt my heart somehow break. I knelt down by a river in the midday sun and
            DID A DAVID! I sat and sobbed and gave it to God. I shouted and sang and worshipped God and asked God to
            change my heart if this really was the plan! But God was put into his rightful place in my life: THE
            ABSOLUTE CENTRE.
        </p>

        <p>
            With this new idea of CELIBACY I spoke to some people from my local church who advised me to speak to the
            Catholic Church as it has Nuns who might have some answers for me on HOW YOU DO THIS PRACTICALLY. So I went
            to the Documentary people and told them a little of my story. If it was right that I go then God would make
            it happen, in his amazing way. My other reasons for wanting to go were I imagined Nuns to be devoted in the
            way that I’m devoted to God and I suppose I wanted kindred Spirits in Christ. I was very scared of Nuns, but
            they had what I wanted in part, a completely surrendered life. I didn’t want to be a Nun as that is not my
            calling, but the Passion and Completeness I wanted. Amazingly, they let me in!
        </p>

        <h4>Iona - After</h4>

        <p>
            So much happened while I was in the Convent, my life had been enriched, but that enriching process had taken
            down my London Armour as it was so safe and disconcerting within those walls. In London I’m independent and
            really have to fight for myself in a pretty scary environment of the music industry and the London streets.
            I have no one but God to Protect and Defend me. So when I left I felt completely exposed. I saw my family
            which was really safe and beautiful; I saw my little brother, Hec, in Les Miserables, and I got half way
            through and just felt so naked and vulnerable that I had to find somewhere silent to have a bit of peace
            before the second half. It was like having been in Heaven then sent back out into a very rude, grubby little
            world. I had Culture Shock going in, but the Culture Shock on leaving was so much worse!
        </p>

        <p>
            The love and friendship of the Nuns has meant so much to me since leaving. I hadn’t expected things in my
            life to change and the gift of silence which is naturally so alien to me, I now treasure and seek out. Today
            I am called to live “DEVOTED IN BODY AND SPIRIT TO GOD” which gives me no plan long term, but gives me the
            space just to be me with God, not waiting for a man to sweep me off my feet but not averse to the idea, if
            and when God chose.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Nuns of the Poor Clares in Arundel have become my Sisters and a Blessing in my life I didn’t think I’d
            ever receive. But my life is getting wilder again and busyness can overtake me, but very occasionally I’ll
            go to Mass or follow the Office of Readings along with them, when I’m not racing around from meeting to
            studio on my bike. My time with them is irreplaceable and one of the painful but beautiful times of my life.
