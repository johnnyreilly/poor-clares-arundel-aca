        <h3>Debi</h3>

        <p>
            Six weeks. Those two words jumped off the e-mail had been sent about the programme. Only those two words
            seem to spin in my head for days and nights of indecision. Finally I decided that this project could be the
            opportunity to heal an open wound I had walked around with for nearly 40 years. It would allow me to
            recreate a very painful set of circumstances and be put in a different role. There was a gravitational pull
            to do this that became overwhelming and it went from something I couldn’t possibly contemplate doing, to a
            consuming need to do. I knew there would be a price to be paid and it could mean public condemnation and the
            loss of a business I had spent 5 years working on. I decided on balance that the possible reward of self
            healing would mean more to me and my family.
        </p>

        <p>
            It occurred to me that when people see the programme they will just see me crying, eating vast amounts of
            cabbage and praying and wonder what on earth it was all about! My time in The Convent was and will probably
            always remain a passage from one way of life to another. The process was nothing short of personally
            cathartic for me and it allowed me to work through a childhood pain with an adult perspective. I received
            answer from an environment and gained an experience that I am convinced I could not have got at any other
            time or place or people.
        </p>

        <p>
            Initially I found the way of life hard and extreme, but by halfway through the project I began to feel a
            deepening realization of my place in the universe, the events that shaped my life and a healthier
            perspective of God. I found Readings at Early Prayer a particular help and although it was a huge struggle
            to get up at 5 a.m. every morning, it set the day up for me and would give me a focus to walk around with in
            my heart all day. The hardest thing I found was the daily battle to contain my pain and grief of separation
            from my child and husband and at the same time remain focused on my original need to enter The Convent. The
            daily struggle often left me physically and emotionally exhausted. I personally never left the convent for
            the entire duration and now with hindsight I can see how that was crucial to the process. I wanted that
            entire enclosed feeling and total immersion into a different way of life. It was an immense and overwhelming
            experience and knowing that I gave up to it all, has without a doubt been worth every tear shed.

        <h4>Debi - After</h4>

        <p>
            The Sisters are without exception the most caring and understanding people I have ever met in my life. All
            during that time in their home I felt immensely privileged and in awe of their devotion to a way of life
            that for most of us is alien and hidden. I had and will always have the highest respect for them all. I miss
            them all terribly and at times have felt a little lost without their company.
        </p>

        <p>
            My life since leaving The Convent has mainly been a battle with depression and the practical
            responsibilities of being a mother, wife and children’s entertainer. I unraveled so much of my past and its
            pain that it is taking time to wind in the yarn of a very disjointed life. I think it is because I totally
            immersed myself in the project that I am now finding it a hard and slow process to work through what
            happened to me in there. On a positive note, however, I have made changes to my lifestyle and perspective of
            myself and others which is having a wonderful impact on my life and also my family. When we left, the
            Sisters made and gave us wonderful gifts to remember them by. Without a doubt the greatest gift I received
            was my self-esteem and the knowledge that I am loved for who I am and I am not to blame for the choices that
            others make.

        <p>
            The night before we were due to leave the convent, we had a celebration farewell party with the Sisters. We
            were asked to do a little something in the way of entertainment and this idea came to me the afternoon of
            the party. Excuse the rough and ready style but I hope I get the message across. I started by saying that I
            thought I would tell a funny story. It’s what I do after all, I’m a children’s Storyteller. But then I
            though hard and decided that my whole time in the Convent had been a challenge so why stop now. All the time
            before and during my time in the Convent I was terrified at the prospect of having to cook, as I am a
            hopeless cook. My idea of a recipe is ‘pierce film and place in oven’. But I realized that afternoon that I
            had learned to cook, despite my relatively little time with the Aga. This is what I made.

        <h4>Debi Cake</h4>

        <p>Firstly you will need a large container that has high sides so none of the mixture can escape. </p>

        <p>
            The first ingredient is QUIETNESS. This is quite difficult to come by but it is an essential ingredient as
            nothing will bind together without it. Probably the best place to start looking is in your head. You can get
            a better quality of quietness from your heart although that is difficult to come by for most of us, so your
            head is a good place to start. When you have found quietness empty into the container and this become the
            base for a Debi. IMPORTANT … Make sure there are no noisy lumps still left before adding the next
            ingredient.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next thing you need is PRAYER. Prayer and Quietness can curdle if you add the two together too quickly.
            So the trick here is to add a little of each ingredient a little at a time. A little quietness, a little
            prayer and so on until the two have blended nicely and evenly together. This mixture should then be left to
            just settle in a quiet place away from any distractions.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you feel your Debi is quiet and happy with prayer only then is she ready for some GUIDANCE. This can be
            found in any good Bible, again just add a little at a time. This can be topped up by impartial advice and
            sensible opinions from people who genuinely care. Fold the guidance gently into the mixture so that all
            three ingredients give the Debi a different perspective. Perspective is an essential stage as without it the
            next ingredient will not blend.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next and probably most importantly is LOVE. You can get love from any good Nun as they are usually
            overflowing with it and have plenty to spare. Nuns come in all manner of shapes and sizes but that has no
            bearing or influence on the amount of love they can give. There is no need to worry about plain or self
            raising. As a rule, ALL Nuns are self raising.
        </p>

        <p>
            Be sure to put in plenty of love. Do not worry about overdoing it. The rule here is, you can never have too
            much love. Stir in all the love, pick up the quietness and prayer from the sides and gather the guidance as
            you stir. It is a good idea to add a pinch of HUMILITY and ACCEPTANCE as this stage to give the Debi a
            greater degree of perspective.
        </p>

        <p>
            You may get tired at this stage. Blending all these ingredients in the right way at the right stages is hard
            work and the mixture can fight against the blending method. There is a temptation to just rush the mixture,
            but by far the best and most resilient result comes from slow and constant.
        </p>

        <p>
            At this stage you may find your Debi has become a bit sloshy,..DON’T PANIC !! This is due to Love. It can be
            hard to stir in love if your Debi has no acceptance. If this is the case add some more humility and another
            pinch of acceptance and you will find the love begins to bind. Remember also that the sloshiness is due to
            the mixture producing vast amounts of tears, a common effect when love is poured in.{' '}
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, the mixture is ready for the oven. The Nuns have a very powerful and reliable oven in the Convent. It
            is called ‘GOD’. Set God on high. Position the Debi somewhere in the middle between self esteem and self
            worth, step back and let God do the rest. The warmth from God will help the mixture rise and take on a whole
            new appearance. Cooking time is around six weeks. You can check to see if your Debi is ready by adding a
            last minute crisis and some stressful challenge. If she bounces back she is ready to be turned out back into
            the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the Debi is turned out she should be less anxious and fearful, and have a good sense of self esteem and
            acceptance that there are some things in the world that she is neither to blame for or can be explained but
            most importantly that God loves her no matter what.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally serve her up to waiting and adoring husband and children and she in turn should be able to sustain
            and nurture her family and friends with all the healthy ingredients contained within.
        </p>

        <p>
            Isn’t it ironic that the very thing I was most worried about has been the very thing I have accomplished the
            best. People ask me what is the biggest lesson I have learnt or taken from my experience and time in The
            Convent.{' '}
        </p>

        <p>I tell them, “I’ve learned to cook, FINALLY”. </p>

        <p>No more burnt offerings for Ronnie.</p>
