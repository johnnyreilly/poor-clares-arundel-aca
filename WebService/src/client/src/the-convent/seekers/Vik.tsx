        <h4>My Story</h4>

        <p>
            I am not a Christian, nor do I hold any particular faith. I was raised without religious influence and did
            not attend Church. I was never given religion as an answer to any of my questions in life, but I did read a
            lot of poetry that contained questions about the meaning of life. In many respects, I was raised an atheist
            but I have grown over the years to understand a sense of my own spiritual journey, both as a woman and as a
            poet. The opportunity to take part in the programme proposed a challenge – of both facing my own resistance
            to religion and also of giving time and space and reflection into myself. When I saw the advert, it struck
            something very deep inside – an awareness of my own deep need for that space and silence. I simply knew it
            was where I had to be and what I had to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my life I have always tried to listen closely to those little signs and whispers as guides to my path.
            This one was like a big tannoy announcement – so I did what I knew I had to do, and applied! Believe me, it
            surprised me and all those I knew and I could not explain it – it was simply a matter of having to trust and
            be open to the journey. That simple act of trust was an important step for me at that time, as I had lost
            faith in trusting that intuitive whisper in the past couple of years.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2003 I had lost my first child in pregnancy. This experience took me deeply into grief and also into a
            stage in my journey I call “entering the underworld”. The hardest thing was the loss of a deeply seated
            faith in my path and in Love. I felt cheated and angry and overwhelmed by the scars of life and unbelievably
            alone. I feared change and I feared trusting in anything. Despite a lifetime of holding that trust through
            dark and difficult times, I reached a point of exhaustion, anger and crippling inertia and I felt fury at
            the betrayal, and turned that anger into myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            I knew I could not live a life this way, but I was struggling to find my own way through, and struggling to
            let in anyone else to help, yet I knew I had to apply for this programme and somewhere, deep inside, I knew
            that it was meant to be – and true enough, all the obstacles to me taking part just refused to stay put. I
            was not getting out of this one that easy! I didn’t know what to expect, it was completely outside anything
            I had experienced before, but I entered it with an open heart, which is all I could bring as my gift. During
            my time in the Convent, I honoured the experience by writing a fragment, or poem each day. This was Day 1:
        </p>

        <p>
            Day 1<br />
            Love unfolds its arms to me
            <br />
            and asks if I am willing.
        </p>

        <p>
            I falter, look for traps; <br />
            an eye on the door- <br />
            trust comes less easy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Something, something beckons, <br />
            whispers yes, nudges doubt along <br />
            until I find myself saying
        </p>

        <p>
            come in, come in <br />
            and enter my house,
            <br />
            even if its ways will break <br />
            the careful order of my rooms.
        </p>

        <h4>Vik - And afterwards...</h4>

        <p>
            During my time with the Sisters, I felt my heart open and I faced my own reluctance to surrender and listen
            to something deeper – that whisper of Love. The experience helped me to trust and find strength in my path,
            to trust in who I am and to allow my path to unfold into its truth. It is a journey that continues as every
            day I am opening to it.{' '}
        </p>

        <p>
            In chapel one night, tired and worn by the weight of a lifetime of following a path and getting wounded
            along the way, I prayed harder than I have ever done before – and I did what I have never done before – I
            wept and surrendered all the pain and anger and frustration and doubts and said “OK – you have it” - and in
            the silence I felt it taken from me, my body filled with light and I heard a simple question: “Do you choose
            this path? Now is your time of choice – because you do not have to walk it – it can be taken from you now,
            and you can go in peace.” I knew at that time, that this really was a time to choose and from deep within
            me, I answered “I choose this path”, and I realized, as I heard it inside myself, that this was true. For
            all its times of trouble and grief, I knew it was my path to follow – the path of Love, the journey of the
            Fool – and I knew it was the path I had always followed.
        </p>

        <p>
            I didn’t know where it would lead, but I embraced it, and myself, and simultaneously, felt embraced.
            Recently I re-found my initial application to the programme and in it I wrote:
        </p>

        <p>
            “Perhaps this experience is a way of engaging in my life and maybe a chance to come to some state of ‘grace’
            in the grief of losing my child. Maybe too it is a chance to put to rest a past and to embrace a future. But
            mostly, it is a chance to quietly listen . . .”
        </p>

        <p>
            And it was. I am still on the journey, and coming to terms with expressing my own spirituality is a
            challenge. I still do not agree with much of organized religion, and I have not ‘converted’ but I have found
            in my life the courage to at least express my truth and my sense of the divine, and I have found a deeper
            faith in who I am and love that woman, as deeply as she was accepted and loved by the Sisters at Crossbush,
            and by that something ‘other’ that for now, I do not name, but know.
        </p>

        <p>
            The journey continues as I too continue to unfold . . so to close, here is the poem from Day 40. May the
            river always keep flowing...
        </p>

        <p>
            Day 40
            <br />
            O Love – <br />
            you have shattered me,
            <br />
            poured me out <br />
            like the river to the sea;
            <br />
            <br />
            let me keep flowing.
        </p>
    </>
