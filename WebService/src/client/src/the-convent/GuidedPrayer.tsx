        <h3>Guided Prayer - Praying With the Seekers</h3>

        <p>
            When the Seekers were with us we had a time of guided prayer for them each Monday evening. Some of these
            prayer sessions are reproduced below, if you would like to try them yourself. Each session lasted 30-40
            minutes, so allow plenty of time to pause between the different parts. At the end of each session we had a
            time of sharing, when each person was free to say how it had been for them, or to remain silent if they
            preferred not to share.
        </p>

        <h4>Stillness exercise</h4>

        <p>
            Find a position you are comfortable in and then try to stay still.
            <br />
            Listen to the sounds around you and as you recognise them, let them go.
            <br />
            The train passing by
            <br />
            The cars <br />
            An aeroplane
        </p>

        <p>
            Listen to sounds a bit nearer to home
            <br />
            Movement in the house
            <br />
            Water running
            <br />
            Someone passing by
        </p>

        <Card className="float-right">
            <CardImg top src={smallSanDamianoCrucifix} />
        </Card>

        <p>
            Now listen to the sounds in the room
            <br />
            The clock ticking
            <br />
            Someone moving
            <br />
            As you recognise each sound, let it go.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now notice your body.
            <br />
            Notice how you feel
            <br />
            Notice whether you are comfortable.
            <br />
            Don’t change anything, just notice.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now notice your breathing
            <br />
            Don’t change it, just notice the breath going in and out.
            <br />
            As you breathe in, take into yourself the peace that is around you
            <br />
            God’s peace
            <br />
            Breathe in the peace.
            <br />
            Breathe out any disturbance
            <br />
            Breathe in His peace
            <br />
            Breathe out any negativity
            <br />
            Breathe in the peace
            <br />
            Breathe out any fear, any worries
        </p>

        <p>
            Let His light and love come into you with each breath.
            <br />
            Let go all darkness,
            <br />
            Let light fill you.
            <br />
            Stay a while in the light and peace.
            <br />
            Notice how you feel
            <br />
            Give thanks for it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Read John 1:35-42: <br />
            John was there with two of his disciples. When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, ‘Look, the Lamb of God!’
            When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. Turning round, Jesus saw them following and
            asked, ‘What do you want?’ They said, ‘Rabbi, where are you staying?’ ‘Come’, he replied, ‘and you will
            see.’ So they went and saw where he was staying and spent that day with Him
        </p>

        <p>Read the passage a couple of times, pausing between to let it sink in.</p>

        <p>
            Take a little while to listen to the sounds around you.
            <br />
            Hear the cars going by
            <br />
            Notice movement in the house
            <br />
            Notice the sounds within the room
            <br />
            As you hear each sound, let it go.
        </p>

        <p>
            Go in imagination to the river where John the Baptist is preaching and baptising.
            <br />
            See the river. What is it like? Wide? Deep? Shallow? Look at it.
            <br />
            What is the weather like? Sun or cloud, rain? <br />
            Feel the breeze.
            <br />
            Notice the people. <br />
            John the Baptist. <br />
            His disciples.
            <br />
            Yourself.
        </p>

        <p>
            Jesus walks by.
            <br />
            Hear John say, ‘Behold, the Lamb of God.’
            <br />
            Two disciples follow Jesus. Watch them.
            <br />
            You go with them.
            <br />
            Walk with Jesus and the disciples.
            <br />
            Listen to their conversation.
            <br />
            If they are not talking, just walk with them. Hear Jesus ask, ‘What do you want?’
            <br />
            Hear their response, ‘Where do you live?’
            <br />
            Jesus says, ‘Come and see.’
            <br />
            Go with them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let the disciples drop behind a little.
            <br />
            You are now walking with Jesus.
            <br />
            Hear Him ask you, ‘What do you want?’
            <br />
            Hear your own response.
        </p>

        <p>
            You arrive at the house, go in with Him.
            <br />
            Stay with Him as long as you want to.
        </p>

        <p>
            Take a little time to notice how you feel and to reflect back on the time of prayer.
            <br />
            If you are with others, share a little with each other.
        </p>

        <h4>Examen of Consciousness</h4>

        <Card className="float-right">

        </Card>

        <p>
            St Ignatius of Loyola developed a pattern of looking back over the day, the week, the year, to see what is
            life-giving. It is a way of using little things to get in touch with our deepest desires, our most real
            selves, and when in touch with ourselves, we can make choices which are more life-giving for us. The
            exercise which follows has its roots in Ignatius’ Examen.
        </p>

        <p>Decide before starting whether you are looking at a day, a week, or what period.</p>

        <p>
            Take a while to become still.
            <br />
            Listen to the sounds around and let go of them.
            <br />
            Breathe in God’s unconditional love, and breathe it out to all around (the atmosphere as well as the
            people).
            <br />
            Breathe in God’s love.
            <br />
            Breathe out God’s love.
        </p>

        <p>
            For what am I most grateful?
            <br />
            For what am I least grateful?
        </p>

        <p>
            When did I feel most alive?
            <br />
            When did I feel life draining out of me?
        </p>

        <p>
            What gave me the most life?
            <br />
            What took life from me?
        </p>

        <p>
            What was today’s high point?
            <br />
            What was today’s low point?
        </p>

        <p>What was most special about that moment? Enter it again, absorb it.</p>

        <p>What was difficult? Accept the feelings. Let God’s love fill you.</p>

        <p>Give thanks for all, whether good or bad.</p>
    </>
